The "neolib" C++ utility library is dependent on the following 3rd party components which must be installed separately:

* Boost (set environment variable "DevDirBoost" to point to directory root of library)
* OpenSSL (set environment variable "DevDirOpenSSL" to point to directory root of library)
* zlib  (set environment variable "DevDirZlib" to point to directory root of library)
